📈 Algo Trader – Stock Price Predictor
A Python-based intelligent stock recommendation and prediction system that analyzes user preferences (investment, risk, and tenure) to forecast stock price trends and suggest optimal investment options.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to simplify stock market decisions by using machine learning models to predict stock trends and guide users based on:

Investment amount

Risk appetite (Low / Medium / High)

Investment duration (Short-term / Mid-term / Long-term)

🛠 Features

🤖 Recommends stocks based on personalized financial profiles

🔁 Automatically updates stock data (if connected to live source)

📉 Visualizes historical and predicted stock trends

🧠 Uses models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and more

🔧 Technologies Used
Python (core language)

Pandas, NumPy – for data preprocessing

Scikit-learn – for model training and evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization

yfinance / Alpha Vantage API (optional) – for fetching live stock data
